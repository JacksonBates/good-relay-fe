# Good Relay Frontend

This is a demo app to accompany the Good Reads Relay demo.

As it currently stands, everything is hardcoded just to make it clear how a frontend app can communicate with the backend relay.

All of the fun stuff is in `src/Component.js`.

To run, simply `npm install` the dependencies and the `npm start` the app.

It's intentionally minimalistic - it's just to demo the concept.

You'll need your backend relay running, also. This demo assumes the backend is running on localhost:3000.
